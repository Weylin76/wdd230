            <h2>Alma 5:47</h2>
            <p>And moreover, I say unto you that it has thus been revealed unto me, that the words which have been
                spoken by our fathers are true, even so according to the spirit of prophecy which is in me, which is
                also by the manifestation of the Spirit of God.</p>

            <h2>2 Nephi 25:23</h2>
            <p>For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ,
                and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.</p>
